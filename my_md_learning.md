# My MD Learning
This is my first MD document. I need more exercise on it.

## the text formating
Here I go to perform some text formating.

First to try a **Bold** text.
And this is an *Italic* text.
Now for a ~~strikethrough~~ text.

The above lines have no line break,<br>
Here we have one, using `<br>`.

I can have code using the \`code\` embedded in a line, like this:<br>
this is a `code`. 

Then to try a text block using \`\`\`
```
`First line`
`Second Line`
"Third Line"
```
the \`\`\` pair can also be used in an single line: ``` there is a ` in the code```.
